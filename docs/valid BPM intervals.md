## Valid Beep Intervals

The valid nominal pulse intervals expressed in milliseconds (ms) and in BPM (beeps per minute) are:

    250ms   (240 BPM)
    750ms   (80 BPM) 
    1250ms  (48 BPM)
    1750ms  (34.29 BPM)
    2000ms  (30 BPM) 
    3000ms  ( 20 BPM)
    3750ms  ( 16 BPM)

However the encoding of fast telemtry between beeps means that the interval between beeps can vary. The fast telemetry pulse delays are:

| Pulse Delay (ms) | Encoded Value | 
|------------------|---------------|
| 0 | 0
